[CLICK TO SEE LIVE VERSION](https://the-pocketzoo.web.app/)

- This is a web application that I developed in early 2022. It displays zoo animals from an API. 
- I created a minimalist UI (User Interface),
- and applied API fetching to an Animal API, returning data in JSON format.
- React does the work on the Frontend.

Technologies used: React, Javascript, HTML, CSS
